#Phase 2 Final Project

#Project title: Friend Group Events

# WHAT INSPIRED MY PROJECT
Having a large group of friends in your 30's can be a lot! As my friends grow their families and/or their achievements in life, keeping up with celebrations can get overwhelming! I lose track of friend events often, as so do other of my friends. This single-page-app can help a group of friends keep track of all of internal group friend events!

# WHAT DOES MY APPLICATION DO
* This application lists up-and-coming events
* It allows you to add/create an event (name, date, description, and event link)
* You are able to see events in order by date

### How to use
* Fork and clone
* In your terminal: $ npm start 
* From here, you should be able to see Home page and use navigation bar to click and see events and/or add events

### SOME CHALLENGES I FACED
I really wanted for a user to click on a "see more details" link on an individual event and be directed to separate UPL parameter to see a full description of THAT individual event (/events:id), but I failed! 
I could not get just ONE event to render, all would render or my "...loading" would only render, so I settled for the link directing users to an external site :(.
